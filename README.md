# Fibonacci Recursion vs Iteration

# What is the Fibonacci Sequence?
The Fibonacci numbers form a sequence such that each number is the sum of the two 
preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1. Example:
``` bash
1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5 ...144+233 = 377, etc
```

# Purpose
To compare runtime efficiency of recursion and iteration 

# Prerequisites
User will need Java installed. 
Download from here: https://java.com/en/download/win10.jsp

# Installing
No additional installation required

# Running 
* User will be prompted to select a recursive or iteration method
* Selection will then prompt the user to enter an integer
* Input of integer will run the Fibonnaci calculation and output the correct result
* Time to execute is displayed for comparison

# Built With
Eclipse
